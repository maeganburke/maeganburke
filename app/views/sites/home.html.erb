				<p>This course will break down the principles behind the alignment, through scientific understanding of muscles, joints and fascia. Once you understand these principles, you will be able to apply them to all variations of asanas.</p>
				<p>We will explore all the main muscles of the body, as well as our patterns of movement, through asana practice – as opposed to dry lectures.</p>
				<p>We will focus on the bio-mechanic reasons for common yoga injuries, and learn how to prevent them.
				This course is a golden opportunity to get more intimate with your body, to realize what are your weaknesses and imbalances, and to learn how to correct them.</p><br>
